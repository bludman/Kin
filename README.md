Kin
===

I built Kin to get aquainted with RaphaelJS.
Kin is a super simple mini-webapp for playing with a basic kinematic chain that simulates a robotic arm.

Three sliders control the angles of the three revolute joints.
The position of the shoulder joint can be moved within the canvas by dragging it to a different position.
